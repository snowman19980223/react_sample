# Getting Started

**⚠️ This project is not production-ready yet!**

Install Primer Components in your application:

```
npm i @primer/components
```

# Usage

All of our components are exported by name from `@primer/components`, so you can import them with:

```js
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Heading,
  Text
} from '@primer/components'
```

## Styling

This project uses [styled-components] under the hood to generate static CSS from all component styles. You do not need to include Primer CSS for this component library to work.

[Primer CSS]: https://github.com/primer/primer
