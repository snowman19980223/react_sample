# Getting Started

Install Primer Components in your project with npm:

```
npm install @primer/components
```

# Usage

All of our components are exported by name from `@primer/components`, so you can import them with:

```js
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Heading,
  Text
} from '@primer/components'
```

Primer Components come with all the necessary CSS built-in, so you don't need to worry about including [Primer CSS].

## Base styles

You can establish base Primer styles for your app by wrapping all of your Primer components in `<BaseStyles>`:

```jsx
import {BaseStyles, Box, Heading} from '@primer/components'

export default () => (
  <BaseStyles>
    <Box m={4}>
      <Heading mb={2}>Hello, world!</Heading>
      <p>This will get Primer text styles.</p>
    </Box>
  </BaseStyles>
)
```

This will set the `color`, `font-family`, and `line-height` CSS properties to the same ones used in [primer-base](https://github.com/primer/primer/blob/master/modules/primer-base/lib/base.scss#L15).
