# Getting Started

Install Primer Components in your application:

```
npm i @primer/components
```

# Usage

All of our components are exported by name from `@primer/components`, so you can import them with:

```js
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Heading,
  Text
} from '@primer/components'
```

## Styling

This project uses [emotion] under the hood to generate static CSS from _some_ component styles, but still relies on [Primer CSS] for some component styles that haven't yet been ported over.

To ensure proper styling, you'll need to link to the most recent build of [Primer CSS] in one of the following ways:

1. If you're using webpack, you can install [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) and [css-loader](), `import 'primer/build/build.css'` in your bundle, and include the following in your webpack config's `module.rules` list:

    ```js
    {
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
    }
    ```

1. **For pre-production applications**, you can link directly to [the build on unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/primer/build/build.css).

1. Otherwise, you can `npm install --save primer` and either or link `node_modules/primer/build/build.css` to your source directory.
