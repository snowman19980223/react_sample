# Primer Components Philosophy


## Everything is a component

## Building Blocks vs Pattern Components vs Helper Components

All of our components can be categorized into three different types.

- Building Blocks
Building block components are components that are basic in their functions and can be use together with other components to build just about any UI. Some examples of building block components are `Box`, `Avatar`, `Details`, and `Link`.

- Pattern Components
Pattern components are components that are made up of several building block components to represent a commonly used pattern in our UI. Some examples of pattern components are `UnderlineNav` and `FilterList`. We plan on expanding our offering of pattern components in the near future.

- Helper Components

Helper components are components that help the user achieve common CSS patterns while maintaining some control over values used. Some examples of helper components are `Flex`, `Text`, `Grid`, and the `Position` components.

## Building components should be flexible

## Pattern components should be opinionated
