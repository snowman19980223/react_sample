# Box

The Box component serves as a wrapper component for most layout related needs. Use Box to set values such as `display`,  `width`, `height`, and more. See the LAYOUT section of our [System Props](/components/docs/system-props) documentation for the full list of available props.

## Default example

```.jsx
<Box display="inline-block" width="300px" bg="blue.4">This is a Box</Box>
```

## System props

Box components get the `COMMON` and `LAYOUT` categories of system props. Read our [System Props](/components/docs/system-props) doc page for a full list of available props.

## Component props

Box does not get any additional props other than its system props mentioned above.


export const meta = {displayName: 'Box'}
