# Contribution guidelines

## Tools we use

### Components
1. We use [emotion] to style our components, and [emotion-theming] as the theme
   provider.
1. We use most of the "conventional" style functions from [styled-system].
1. We use [system-components] as the foundation for [abstract
   components](#abstract-components) (those with only [system
   props](#system-props)).

Check the [component patterns] for more information about how we structure
different types of components.

## Component patterns

### Abstract components
Components that _only_ implement style functions [styled-system] can be
bootstrapped in a single statement with [system-components]:

```jsx
import system from 'system-components/emotion'
const Box = system('borders', 'color', 'space')
```

This is awesome because:

1. We don't have to import the style functions from [styled-system] directly;
   the library looks them up for us by name.
1. We get all of the style functions' prop-types merged into the component
   class's `propTypes` automatically.
1. Our component class renders a `<div>` by default, but can be told to render
   any other element or component with the `is` prop.

#### Concrete components
Concrete components are ones that actually "do" something other than just
rendering styles. There are a couple of different ways to create these,
depending on what you need to do:

1. If you're just adding class names (e.g. for Primer CSS), you can pass the
   `className` prop to an abstract component, and it will be combined with any
   classes generated by [emotion].

    ```jsx
    import Box from './Box'

    export default function FancyBox({flashing, ...rest}) {
      return <Box className={flashing && 'Box--flashing'} {...rest} />
    }

    FancyBox.propTypes = {
      flashing: PropTypes.bool,
      // be sure to spread Box's prop-types
      ...Box.propTypes
    }
    ```

    Note that with this form, you can control whether users may pass additional
    `className` props to your component. If you want to allow this, it should
    be listed in `propTypes` and combined with your own classnames with the
    [classnames] package:

    ```jsx
    import classnames from 'classnames'
    import Box from './Box'

    export default function FancyBox({flashing, className, ...rest}) {
      const classes = classnames(className, flashing && 'Box--flashing')
      return <Box className={classes} {...rest} />
    }

    FancyBox.propTypes = {
      className: PropTypes.string,
      flashing: PropTypes.bool,
      ...Box.propTypes
    }
    ```

1. Alternatively, you can create the component from scratch using the named
   system props using a slightly different form of the `system()` function from
   [system-components]:

    ```jsx
    import classnames from 'classnames'
    import system from 'system-components/emotion'

    const FancyBox = ({flashing, className, is: Tag, ...rest}) => {
      return (
      <Tag
        className={classnames(className, flashing && 'Box--flashing')}
        {...rest}
      />
      )
    }

    FancyBox.propTypes = {
      flashing: PropTypes.bool
    }

    export default system({is: FancyBox}, 'borders', 'colors', 'space')
    ```

    In this case, you will need to deal explicitly with two props passed down
    from [emotion] and [system-components], respectively:

    * `className`: You _must_ render this prop, otherwise **your component will
      not be styled.**
    * `is`: This is what allows your component to render with arbitrary
      elements, and even other components. If you don't respect this prop, you
      should `delete Component.propTypes.is` to signal that it's not available.

## Glossary

### System props
System props are style functions that provide on or more props and can be
passed directly the return value of [emotion]'s `styled()` function:

```jsx
import {styled} from 'react-emotion'
import {space} from 'styled-system'
const SpaceDiv = styled('div')(space)
```

System props come with `propTypes` that can be mixed into your own with ES6
[spread syntax]:

```jsx
SpaceDiv.propTypes = {
  stellar: PropTypes.bool,
  ...space.propTypes
}
```
