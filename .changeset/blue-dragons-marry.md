Adds truncation features to the LabelGroup component:
- truncate LabelGroup children after a static number of children (for example, truncate after the 5th label)
- truncate LabelGroup children to fit in the width of the parent
- show full list in an Overlay
- show full list inline

<!-- Changed components: LabelGroup -->
