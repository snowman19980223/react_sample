Type definitions are now being generated by TypeScript instead of manually maintained. These new type definitions may differ from the previous type definitions and cause breaking changes. If you experience any new TypeScript errors, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/primer/components/issues) or reach out in Slack (#design-systems).

### Breaking changes

* The following types are no longer exported:

   ```
   BaseProps
   UseDetailsProps
   AnchoredPositionHookSettings
   AnchorAlignment 
   AnchorSide
   PositionSettings
   PaginationHrefBuilder
   PaginationPageChangeCallback 
   PositionComponentProps
   ```

* Props are now defined with types instead of interfaces which means in some cases you may not be able to create interfaces that `extend` them. To work around this issue, you may need to convert your interfaces to types:

  ```diff
  import {BoxProps} from '@primer/components'
  
  - interface MyFancyBox extends BoxProps {...}
  + type MyFancyBox = BoxProps & {...}
  ```
  
* Some components now expect more specific ref types. For example:
  
  ```diff
  - const ref = React.useRef<HTMLElement>(null)
  + const ref = React.useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)
  
  return <Button ref={ref}>...</Button>
  ```
