# Overlay

### Open questions
- should we allow custom heights/widths?

- Should we handle showing/hiding the overlay when isOpen is false? In Memex it seems like they prefer to do an early return if a component isn't rendered it doesn't get added to the DOM if it isn't being used to help with perf. Are there any accessibility concerns we should be aware of if we take this approach?


- think through whether or not to forward refs on Overlay
- I'm not sure how we should handle showing/hiding the overlay content based on the isOpen state. Things we have to consider:

- We should avoid calling the overlay hooks if we aren't going to render the overlay.
- But we can't return null before calling the overlay hook because that violates the rules of hooks
- If we conditionally render the overlay in the consuming component, the overlay has no knowledge of when the overlay is not open, so we can't do stuff like return focus


## useOnOutsideClick

- ~~should we also handle touch events?~~ added this in


## useReturnFocus

- takes a ref and an isOpen
- when isOpen changes to false, we focus the ref
