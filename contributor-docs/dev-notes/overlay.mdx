# Overlay

### Open questions
- should we allow custom heights/widths?

- Should we handle showing/hiding the overlay when isOpen is false? In Memex it seems like they prefer to do an early return if a component isn't rendered it doesn't get added to the DOM if it isn't being used to help with perf. Are there any accessibility concerns we should be aware of if we take this approach?

## useOnOutsideClick

- ~~should we also handle touch events?~~ added this in


## useReturnFocus

- takes a ref and an isOpen
- when isOpen changes to false, we focus the ref
