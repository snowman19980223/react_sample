# Primer react
⚠️ This project is WIP and not ready for production use yet!

[Primer](https://primer.github.io/) React components built with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) 💅 and [styled-system](http://jxnblk.com/styled-system/) 💙.

## Getting started

`npm install`

Run app with:

`npm run start`

Build with:

`npm run build`

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Aim for total style encapsulation, don't rely on inheritance to provide default styles.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor extending or wrapping components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).
