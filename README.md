# Primer react

[Primer](https://primer.github.io/) React components

## Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is WIP and not ready for production use yet!**

Currently we link to the latest build of [Primer CSS] so that we may use current Primer styles to start to build components. This does not include `primer-base` so as to avoid unwanted base overrides.

## Installation

Install primer-react in your project with npm:

```
npm install primer-react
```

## Usage

**If you are upgrading from a version before `1.0.0-beta`, please read the [migration docs](migrating.md).**

All of our components are exported by name from `primer-react`, so you can import them with:

```js
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Heading,
  Text
} from 'primer-react'
```

### Styling

This project uses [emotion] to generate static CSS for most component styles, but still relies on [Primer CSS] for some classname-based styles that haven't yet been ported over.

To ensure proper styling of all Primer components, you'll need to include some static CSS that's distributed with the `@primer/components` npm package in `dist/primer-components.css`. Here's how:

1. If you're using a JavaScript bundler that supports CSS imports, you can import it in your bundles directly:

    ```js
    import '@primer/components/dist/css/build.css'
    ```
    
    If you're using webpack, you'll need to install [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) and  configure webpack to use it for imports ending in '.css', e.g.
    
    ```js
    {
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /\.css$/,
            use: 'style-loader'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

1. If you run a Node server, you can read the file from disk at startup:

    ```jsx
    const {readFileSync} = require('fs')
    const cssPath = require.resolve('@primer/components/dist/primer-components.css')
    const css = readFileSync(cssPath, 'utf8')
    ```
    
    Then, inline it into the `<head>` of your HTML template(s) or render it server-side in React like so:
    
    ```jsx
    // assuming the `css` variable is set as above
    export default () => (
      <html>
        <head>
          <style>{css}</style>
        </head>
        <body>
          ...
        </body>
      </html>
    )
    ```
    
3. For fully static apps, you may need to copy `node_modules/@primer/components/dist/css/build.css` (after running `npm install --save @primer/components`) to your site directory, e.g.

    ```sh
    cp node_modules/@primer/components/dist/css/build.css assets/primer-components.css
    ```
    
    Then link to it within the `<head>` of your HTML document(s):
    
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/primer-components.css">
    ```

#### Static CSS rendering

Some Primer components rendered client-side may produce a [flash of unstyled content]. You can avoid this by using one of the above techniques and following the instructions for [Emotion server-side rendering](https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr).

This repo's [Next.js document component](https://github.com/primer/components/blob/master/pages/_document.js) illustrates how to combine inlining the static CSS with `emotion-server` for fully server-rendered CSS in [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

## Local Development

To run `primer-react` locally when adding or updating components:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/primer/primer-react`
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Run the dev app: `npm run dev`

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Aim for total style encapsulation; don't rely on inheritance to provide default styles.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor extending or wrapping components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).
