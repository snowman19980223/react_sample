title: Overriding styles with the sx prop
---

Our goal with Primer Components is to hit the sweet spot between providing too little and too much styling flexibility; too little and the design system is too rigid, and too much and it becomes too difficult to maintain a consistent style. Our components already support a standard set of [system props](/system-props), but sometimes a component just isn't *quite* flexible enough to look the way you need it to look. For those cases, we provide the `sx` prop.

The `sx` prop allows ad-hoc styling that is still theme aware. Declare the styles you want to apply in camel-cased object notation, and any values use appropriate theme values; for example, any `color` property values will use the values from the `colors` key in the theme.

## Basic example

This example demonstrates applying a bottom border to `Heading`, a component that does not receive `BORDER` system props. The `borderBottomWidth` value comes from `theme.borderWidths` and `borderBottomColor` comes from `theme.colors`.

```jsx live
<Heading pb={2}>Heading</Heading>

<Heading
  pb={2}
  sx={{
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: 'border.gray',
    borderBottomStyle: 'solid'
  }}>
    Heading with bottom border
</Heading>
```

## Nesting, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements

The `sx` prop also allows for declaring styles based on media queries, psueudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. This example, though contrived, demonstrates the ability:

```jsx live
<Box sx={{
  '> *': {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: 'border.gray',
    borderStyle: 'solid',
    borderBottomWidth: 0,
    padding: 2,
    ':last-child': {
      borderBottomWidth: 1
    },
    ':hover': {
      bg: 'gray.1'
    }
  }
}}>
  <Box>First</Box>
  <Box>Second</Box>
  <Box>Third</Box>
</Box>
```

## When to use the `sx` prop

The `sx` prop clearly provides a lot of power, which means it is an easy tool to abuse. To best make use of it, we recommend following these guidelines:

* Only use the `sx` prop for small stylistic changes to components. For more substantial changes, create your own wrapper using `styled-components`.
* Use [system props](/system-props) instead of the `sx` prop whenever possible.
* Avoid nesting and pseudo-selectors in `sx` prop values when possible.
