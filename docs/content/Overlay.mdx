title: Overlay
---

An `Overlay` is a flexible floating surface, used to display transient content such as menus, selection options, dialogs, and more. Overlays use shadows to express elevation. The `Overlay` component handles all behaviors needed by overlay UIs as well as the common styles that all overlays should have. `Overlay` is the base component for many of our overlay-type components.

Behaviors include:

- Trapping focus
- Calling a user provided function when the user presses `Escape`
- Calling a user provided function when the user clicks outside of the container
- Focusing the either a user provided element, or the first focusable element in the container when it is opened.
- Returning focus to an element when container is closed


Because `Overlay` is rendered inside of a `Portal`, it's important to use `useAnchoredPosition` to correctly position your `Overlay` component.

## Default example

```javascript live noinline
const Demo = () => {
  // you must manage your own open state
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const noButtonRef = React.useRef(null)
  const anchorRef = React.useRef(null)
  return (
    <>
      <Button ref={anchorRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
        open overlay
      </Button>
      {/* be sure to conditionally render the Overlay. This helps with performance and is required. */}
      {isOpen &&
        <Overlay
          anchorRef={anchorRef}
          initialFocusRef={noButtonRef}
          returnFocusRef={anchorRef}
          ignoreClickRefs={[anchorRef]}
          onEscape={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
          onClickOutside={() => setIsOpen(false)}
        >
          <Flex flexDirection="column" p={2}>
            <Button >yes</Button>
            <Button ref={noButtonRef}>no</Button>
          </Flex>
        </Overlay>
      }

    </>
  )
}

render(<Demo/>)
```

## System props

`Overlay` gets `COMMON` system props. Read our [System Props](/system-props) doc page for a full list of available props.

## Component props

| Name | Type   | Default | Description                         |
| :--- | :----- | :-----: | :---------------------------------- |
| ignoreClickRefs   | `React.RefObject []` |  | Optional. An array of ref objects to ignore clicks on in the `onOutsideClick` behavior. This is often used to ignore clicking on the element that toggles the open/closed state for the `Overlay` to prevent the `Overlay` from being toggled twice. |
| inititalFocusRef  | `React.RefObject` |  | Optional. Ref for the element to focus when the `Overlay` is opened. If nothing is provided, the first focusable element in the `Overlay` body is focused.  |
| anchorRef | `React.RefObject` |  | Required. Element the `Overlay` should be anchored to. |
| returnFocusRef  | `React.RefObject` |  | Required. Ref for the element to focus when the `Overlay` is closed.  |
| onClickOutside  | `function` |  | Required. Function to call when clicking outside of the `Overlay`. Typically this function sets the `Overlay` visibility state to `false`.  |
| onEscape  | `function` |  | Required. Function to call when user presses `Escape`. Typically this function sets the `Overlay` visibility state to `false`.  |
| width  | `'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', 'auto'` |  | Sets the width of the `Overlay`, pick from our set list of widths, or pass `auto` to automatically set the width based on the content of the `Overlay`. `sm` corresponds to `256px`, `md` corresponds to `320px`, `lg` corresponds to `480px`, and `xl` corresponds to `640px`.  |
| height  | `'sm', 'md', 'auto'` |  | Sets the height of the `Overlay`, pick from our set list of heights, or pass `auto` to automatically set the height based on the content of the `Overlay`. `sm` corresponds to `480px` and `md` corresponds to `640px`.  |
