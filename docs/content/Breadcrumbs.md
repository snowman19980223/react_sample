Breadcrumbs are used to show taxonomical context on pages that are many levels deep in a siteâ€™s hierarchy. Breadcrumbs show and link to parent, grandparent, and sometimes great-grandparent pages. Breadcrumbs are most appropriate on pages that:

- Are many levels deep on a site
- Do not have a section-level navigation
- May need the ability to quickly go back to the previous (parent) page

To use Breadcrumbs with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) or
[react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom), pass
`as={NavLink}` and omit the `selected` prop.
This ensures that the NavLink gets `activeClassName='selected'`

## Default example

```jsx live
<Breadcrumbs>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item href="/">Home</Breadcrumbs.Item>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item href="/about">About</Breadcrumbs.Item>
  <Breadcrumbs.Item href="/about/team" selected>
    Team
  </Breadcrumbs.Item>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

## System props

<Note variant="warning">

System props are deprecated in all components except [Box](/Box). Please use the [`sx` prop](/overriding-styles) instead.

</Note>

Breadcrumbs and Breadcrumbs.Item components get `COMMON` system props. Read our [System Props](/system-props) doc page for a full list of available props.
