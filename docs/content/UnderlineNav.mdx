Use the UnderlineNav component to style navigation with a minimal underlined selected state, typically used for navigation placed at the top of the page.

## Deprecation

UnderlineNav is deprecated and will be replaced by the draft `UnderlineNav` in the next major release. See [the draft UnderlineNav's docs](/drafts/UnderlineNav2) for more details.

To use UnderlineNav with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) or
[react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom), pass
`as={NavLink}` and omit the `selected` prop.
This ensures that the NavLink gets `activeClassName='selected'`

**Attention:** Make sure to properly label your `UnderlineNav` with an `aria-label` to provide context about the type of navigation contained in `UnderlineNav`.

## Examples

```jsx live
<UnderlineNav aria-label="Main">
  <UnderlineNav.Link href="#home" selected>
    Home
  </UnderlineNav.Link>
  <UnderlineNav.Link href="#documentation">Documentation</UnderlineNav.Link>
  <UnderlineNav.Link href="#support">Support</UnderlineNav.Link>
</UnderlineNav>
```

## Props

<ComponentProps data={data} />
