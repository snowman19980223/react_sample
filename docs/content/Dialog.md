import State from '../components/State'

The dialog component is used for all modals. It renders on top of the rest of the app with an overlay.

You'll need to manage the `isOpen` state in a wrapper component of your own and pass in a function to be used to close the Dialog. For documentation purposes only we've created a mock `State` to handle this, but you should handle the state in the component you consume `Dialog` in or in a wrapper component.

### Accessibility

A few considerations must be made to ensure your use of the `Dialog` component is accessible:

- Always be sure to provide either `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` to your `Dialog` component. In most cases you should use `aria-labelledby` and pass it the `id` of your `Dialog.Header`. If there is no text in your header, or you chose not to use a header, you can use `aria-label` to describe the purpose of the `Dialog`.

- Be sure to pass a ref to return the focus back to once the `Dialog` closes via the `returnFocusRef` prop. In most cases this should be the element that opened the Dialog. If you decide to manage focus within your application and want to bypass Primer React Components from doing so when the `Dialog` closes, you can omit the `returnFocusProp`.

### Z-index

If you're running into z-index issues or are rendering the component inside of an absolutely positioned element, you can wrap your `Dialog` in a [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).

### Examples

```jsx live
<State default={false}>
  {([isOpen, setIsOpen]) => {
    const returnFocusRef = React.useRef(null)
    return (
      <>
        <Button ref={returnFocusRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
          Open
        </Button>
        <Dialog
          returnFocusRef={returnFocusRef}
          isOpen={isOpen}
          onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}
          aria-labelledby="header-id"
        >
          <Dialog.Header id="header-id">Title</Dialog.Header>
          <Box p={3}>
            <Text fontFamily="sans-serif">Some content</Text>
          </Box>
        </Dialog>
      </>
    )
  }}
</State>
```

You can also pass any non-text content into the header:

```jsx live
<State default={false}>
  {([isOpen, setIsOpen]) => {
    const returnFocusRef = React.useRef(null)
    return (
      <>
        <Button ref={returnFocusRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
          Open
        </Button>
        <Dialog
          isOpen={isOpen}
          returnFocusRef={returnFocusRef}
          onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}
          aria-labelledby="label"
        >
          <Dialog.Header>
            <ZapIcon />
          </Dialog.Header>
          <Box p={3}>
            <Text id="label" fontFamily="sans-serif">
              Are you sure you'd like to delete this issue?
            </Text>
            <Box display="flex" mt={3} justifyContent="flex-end">
              <Button mr={1}>Cancel</Button>
              <ButtonDanger>Delete</ButtonDanger>
            </Box>
          </Box>
        </Dialog>
      </>
    )
  }}
</State>
```

## System props

`Dialog` components get the `COMMON` and `LAYOUT` categories of system props. `Dialog.Header` components get `COMMON`, `LAYOUT`, and `FLEX` system props. Read our [System Props](/system-props) doc page for a full list of available props.

## Component props

| Prop name       | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isOpen          | Boolean   | Set whether or not the dialog is shown                                                                                                                    |
| onDismiss       | Function  | A user-provided function that should close the dialog                                                                                                     |
| returnFocusRef  | React ref | The element to restore focus back to after the `Dialog` is closed                                                                                         |
| initialFocusRef | React ref | Element inside of the `Dialog` you'd like to be focused when the Dialog is opened. If nothing is passed to `initialFocusRef` the close button is focused. |
| aria-labelledby | string    | Pass an id to use for the aria-label. Use either a `aria-label` or an `aria-labelledby` but not both.                                                     |
| aria-label      | string    | Pass a label to be used to describe the Dialog. Use either a `aria-label` or an `aria-labelledby` but not both.                                           |

`Dialog.Header` does not take any non-system props.
